    Iâ€™m a C++, Java and React developer with strong side interest in real-time
    applications. I have been working as a programmer for over ten years in the
    UK and Belgium. I now split my time between programming and teaching. My free time is mostly spent working on side-projects such as
    video games, audio plugins or other exciting things (like the interactive timeline below).
