	<!--
      If you are looking at this is that you know what you are looking for. And you'll find it for sure.
      But, isn't the idea behind the implementation the important thing? 
      Is this code any good? No. 
      Do I know how I could improve it? Hell yes.
      Do I have the time? Nope.
      So, please judge me but with compassion. Thank you.
